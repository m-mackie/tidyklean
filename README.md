# ðŸ§¼ TidyKlean â€“ Responsive Product Landing Page

TidyKlean is a **responsive product page** for a fictional eco-friendly laundry detergent. Built as a personal project, this landing page showcases my ability to craft clean, accessible layouts using **semantic HTML** and **modern CSS**, with a strong focus on **Flexbox** for layout and **modular structure** for maintainability.

> This project reflects my progress in front-end development and serves as a visual code sample of my hands-on experience with layout, responsiveness, and CSS organization.
