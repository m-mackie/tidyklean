 
Notes: As someone who knows very little of design. I did my best by watching tutorials to come up with a simple design that I could code to get more experience with CSS, specifically Flexbox, which is one of my weaker points. This product will always be in motion as I use it to hone my CSS skills from the skeleton site it is today to something that will be beautiful and semi-functional.
